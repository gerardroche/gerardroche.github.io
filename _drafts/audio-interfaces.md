title: Audio Interfaces
---

I recently recommended an audio interface to a friend. I say "recommended," but I have nothing to compare it against. All I could really tell him was that it worked, and I have no complaints.

Well, there is one complaint: I had to buy a preamp for my microphone, the [Shure SM7B]. The preamp cost more than the interface, and you need an extra cable too. It adds up.

"When selecting a preamp for the SM7 for voice-over work," [Shure advises](https://service.shure.com/s/article/sm7-output-level-and-preamp-gain-specifications?language=en_US), "make certain the preamp has a minimum 60 dB of gain".

The [3rd Gen Focusrite Scarlett 2i2], the interface I bought, has 56 dB of gain, older versions have less than that.

So, I bought the [Cloudlifter CL-1], which adds 25 dB of gain.

Had I known these things before I bought an interface, I would have tried to find one with enough gain without needing the additional That being said, I likely would have still ended up going the additional preamp route.

Most interfaces with a minimum of 60 dB of gain cost more than a basic interface+preamp setup. For instance, the [Universal Audio Apollo Twin] has 65 dB of gain but is about 8 times the cost of a basic interface and 4 times the cost of a basic interface+preamp setup.

The friend went ahead and bought a [Scarlett Solo], but he regrets buying it because the Solo doesn't have a separate headphones volume control like the 2i2. The 2i2 has two volume controls, one for the line-out speakers and another for the headphones.

He needs to turn down the volume on the actual speakers when using headphones. I can understand why this would be a headache.

The [Universal Audio Volt 1] is similar to the Solo; it's in the same price range, but it has two volume controls. That's something to consider if you're looking at the Scarlett Solo. I think he would have been happier with the Volt.

Will you still need a preamp with a Volt? It seems the [available gain on the Volt interfaces] is 55 dB. So yes, at least for microphones like the SM7B.

I know what you're dying to know. Is the SM7B good? I have nothing to compare it to. So yes.

I actually have a [Shure SM57], but I don't use it for voice and haven't compared it to the SM7B... yet.
