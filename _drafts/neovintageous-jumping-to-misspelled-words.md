title: NeoVintageous - Jumping to Misspelled Words
---

NeoVintageous has two commands to jump to misspelled words:

Command | Description
:------ | :----------
<kbd>[s</kbd> | Jump backward to the previous misspelled word.
<kbd>]s</kbd> | Jump forward to the next misspelled word.

With a count, it means jup that many times e.g. `3]s` jumps to the third misspelled word. `'wrapscan'` applies.
