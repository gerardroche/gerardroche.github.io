> It's estimated that there are approximately 100 billion stars (10^11) in our
  galaxy, of which, say, 1/10th support a planet. Of these approximately 10
  billion stars, perhaps one out of a hundred contains a planet which lies
  within the life zone of the star, not too close for its solvent, water or
  methane or whatever, to boil away and not too far to be frozen solid. Now
  we're down to approximately 100 million stars (10^8) in our galaxy which
  could support life. Since most of them are considerably smaller than our sun,
  only about 1/10th of these stars should be considered reasonable candidates
  for supporting planets with life. Still, this leaves us with 10 million
  stars (10^7) in our galaxy alone capable of supporting life, of which perhaps
  1/10th have already developed life! Let's assume that there indeed 10^6 -- or
  a million -- stars with planets which support life in our own galaxy. Why
  don't we see any evidence? <cite>John Allen Paulos, Innumeracy</cite>
