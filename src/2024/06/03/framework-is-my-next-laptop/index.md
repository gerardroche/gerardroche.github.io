# Framework is my next laptop

[Framework](https://frame.work) is going to be my next laptop. I don't want to buy another laptop with Windows pre-installed. I don't use Windows. I don't see why I should have to pay for it.

I'm tired of throwing out devices that still have good parts in them. One of my laptops is reaching its end of life, but there only a few things wrong with it.

- The internal battery has died. I have to keep it plugged in and the connector is getting flaky.
- The keys have gone spongy. It's hit and miss.
- A fan is failing.

If this was a Framework I could just replace these parts. Easy. Done and done.

I know I could probably find parts and somehow replace them, but in some cases maybe not. Would I be able to replace the keyboard? It seems like a lot of time and effort.

If the big corps really cared about climate change, they would have done what Framework has done, a long time ago.

I'm looking forward to it. Excited. I hope it's as good people say it is. I hope it serves me well into the future. I hope it inspires me to build great things. I hope.
