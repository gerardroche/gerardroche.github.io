    link: '/2024/06/30/on-which-type-and-readlink-commands/'
    details: "The which command identifies the location of commands. It searches the system PATH for executables. The -a option prints all matching locations. To inspect the PATH, use tr to split it into separate lines for improved readability."

    link: '/2024/06/03/framework-is-my-next-laptop/'
    details: "Framework is going to be my next laptop. I don't want to buy another laptop with Windows pre-installed. I don't use Windows. I don't see why I should have to pay for it."

  - title: "bash or sh"
    link: '/2024/05/30/bash-or-sh/'
    details: "I prefer sh over bash. I begin almost every script with the same four lines. A POSIX-compliant shell, exit immediately on error, unset CDPATH, and unset IFS."
