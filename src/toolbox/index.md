# Toolbox

Here are things I use on a daily basis. You'll thank me later.

## Workstation

### [IDÅSEN desk sit/stand 160x80 black/dark](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/p/idasen-desk-sit-stand-brown-beige-s89280969/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

I'm very happy with this desk. When I purchased this in 2021, it was €550, it's now €715. I also picked up some useful accessories like [cable trunking](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/p/signum-cable-trunking-horizontal-silver-colour-30200253/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) and [Gravity Headphones Holder](https://www.thomann.de/ie/gravity_headphones_holder_f_desk.htm?ref=blog.gerardroche.com).

### [JÄRVFJÄLLET office chair, Glose black](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/p/jaervfjaellet-office-chair-with-armrests-glose-black-20510642/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

This chair is perfectly fine. I use it without armrests: I like to noodle on guitar when I'm waiting. When I purchased it, it was €200, now it's €250.

### [Yamaha HS 7 MP Studio Monitors](https://www.thomann.de/ie/yamaha_hs_7_mp.htm?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

I'm very happy with these.

### [Shure SM 7 B](https://www.thomann.de/ie/shure_sm_7b_studiomikro.htm?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

Very well made. It looks like it will last forever. High quality audio.

I had to buy a [Cloudlifter, CL-1, Microphone preamp](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Microphones-Cloudlifter-CL-1-Microphone-Amplifier/dp/B004MQSV04/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) (was £115, it's now £150), which adds 25 dB of gain, because the SM7 needs a [minimum of 60 dB](https://service.shure.com/s/article/sm7-output-level-and-preamp-gain-specifications?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) and my [audio interface](#focusrite-scarlett-2i2-audio-interface) only has 56 dB. It looks like Shure has noticed this common use-case issue and released [an SM7 with integrated preamp](https://www.thomann.de/ie/shure_sm_7_db.htm?ref=blog.gerardroche.com), if you prefer that.

### [Rode PSA-1](https://www.thomann.de/ie/rode_psa1.htm?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

A microphone studio arm mounted to my desk. Does the job.

### [Samsung 32" 4K Monitor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-LU32J590UQPXXU-UJ590-UHD-Monitor/dp/B0BS1NMMPD/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

It does the job. I have two older 22" and 24" monitors. The 32" is in the centre with the 22" on the left and the 24", vertical, on the right. I'm happy with the [3 Invision Single Monitor Arms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Invision-Single-Monitor-Mount-Screens-Black/dp/B09963RQ6Y/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com). I almost never move the monitors.

### [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Audio Interface](https://www.thomann.de/ie/focusrite_scarlett_2i2_4th_generation.htm?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

It does the job. I have the 3rd gen model. I'm glad I sprung for the 2i2 instead of the solo, because the solo has no dedicated headphone volume knob. It looks like they fixed that in the [4th gen model](https://www.thomann.de/ie/focusrite_scarlett_solo_4th_gen.htm?ref=blog.gerardroche.com). The Universal Audio [Volt](https://www.thomann.de/ie/universal_audio_usb_audio_interfaces.html?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) series might be worth looking at too.

### [Das Keyboard 4 Professional mechanical keyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

Built like a brick shithouse. Best keyboard I've ever used.

### [Logitech MX Master 2s Wireless Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/eol/mx-master-2s-mouse.910-005131.html?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

I've had a few MX Master mice. I like them, but they're not made to last. I recently had to take this one apart to fix a stuck gesture button. I don't think I can use that button any more, but I never really used it. I've tried other mice and prefer the MX Master.

### [Sennheiser HD 599 Open Back Headphones, Black](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-Special-Open-Headphone-Black/dp/B07Q7S7247/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

They're a tad ragged at this point, the ear pads have come loose, but they're good comfortable headphones.

### [Logitech C920 HD Pro Webcam](https://www.logitech.com/products/webcams/c920-pro-hd-webcam.960-001055.html?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

This is a good Full HD 1080p webcam. My previous one was the [C270 HD 720p](https://www.logitech.com/products/webcams/c270-hd-webcam.960-001063.html?ref=blog.gerardroche.com). It was fine, it served me well, but it was time to upgrade. The only downside is the lack of configuration tools, but it's a good quality picture.

### [Anti-Fatigue Standing Desk Mat](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B074DTNMLQ/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

The one I got is discontinued, but it's essentially just a cheaper version of the [Ergodriven Topo](https://ergodriven.com/products/topo?ref=blog.gerardroche.com). I couldn't get the Topo at the time, it was only available in the U.S. I was impressed with the quality of the one I landed on. I've had it for over six years. It's still good.

### Desktop

I started my current desktop build around 2018.

#### [Obsidian Series™ 750D Airflow Edition Full Tower ATX Case](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/pc-cases/cc-9011078-ww/obsidian-series-750d-airflow-edition-full-tower-atx-case-cc-9011078-ww?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

This case is enormous. I'm not kidding. I really underestimated the size of it. In the end, I'm very happy with it. I'm not short on space and it's nice to have all that headroom.

#### [ASUS Prime Z370-A Intel 1151 ATX Motherboard](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-z370-a/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

I can't complain. There is still room for upgrades.

#### [Intel® Core™ i7-8700K Processor, 3.70GHz](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07598VZR8/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

12M Cache, up to 4.70 GHz, 6 cores, 12 threads. Overclocked, it runs at 5.0GHz fine, but I just run it at baseline, I like a quiet system. It drives my three monitors, I've yet to get around to purchasing a graphics card. Performance is still good.

I don't do gaming on this system, so I haven't needed a graphics card, the CPU is driving the monitors fine at the moment. The graphics card market has been ridiculous for years, but a graphics card would obviously add a big performance boost.

#### [Corsair H115i RGB Pro Liquid CPU Cooler](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/cpu-coolers/cw-9060044-ww/icue-h115i-rgb-pro-xt-liquid-cpu-cooler-cw-9060044-ww?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

As with most hardware on Linux, the control software doesn't support Linux. In order change the pump speed, fan speed, RGB, etc., you need open source tooling. I use [OpenCorsairLink](https://github.com/audiohacked/OpenCorsairLink?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) to reduce the pump speed at startup, because I like it quiet.

#### [Corsair HX Series™ HX1200 — 1200 W 80+ Platinum PSU](https://www.corsair.com/eu/en/p/psu/cp-9020140-uk/hx-series-hx1200-1200-watt-80-plus-platinum-certified-fully-modular-psu-uk-cp-9020140-uk?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

Probably overkill, but I got a good deal. Lots of headroom.

#### [G.Skill RipjawsV 32 GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4-3200](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B017WST5EE/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

For the initial build I had just 16GB (2 x 8GB), but I recently got a good deal and added 16GB (2 x 8GB). That's all the memory slots on motherboard filled, but I don't even think about memory issues any more. Even at 16GB I stopped worrying.

#### [SSD 960 EVO NVMe® M.2 250GB](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-960-evo-m-2-250gb-mz-v6e250bw/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

I use this drive for my operating system.

#### [SSD 970 EVO Plus NVMe® M.2 500GB](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MFBLN7K/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

For the initial build, I had one M.2 SSD, but I recently got a deal on this one. I use the 250GB for my OS and the 500GB for my projects. I also have a 1TB hard drive for media. That's all the M.2 slots on motherboard filled, but there is still room for more hard drives.

#### [Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPM 1TB HD](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01LNJBA2I/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

I use this drive for media. I have a few external drives for backups.

## Software

### [Gnome + Ubuntu Studio](https://ubuntustudio.org/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

I've been happy with [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) for many years. I like Studio because it comes packed with lots of useful [audio](https://ubuntustudio.org/tour/audio/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com), [graphics](https://ubuntustudio.org/tour/graphics/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com), [photography](https://ubuntustudio.org/tour/photography/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com), and [video](https://ubuntustudio.org/tour/video/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) software, including [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com), and [Ardour](http://ardour.org/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com).

### [Vim](https://www.vim.org/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) - Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor.

I love Vim. Sublime Text is my primary editor, but I use Vim too.

### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) - A programmer's editor.

I use Vim too.

### [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) - A cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator.

Faster, nicer.

### [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) - A cross-platform, GPU based terminal emulator.

Faster, nicer.

### [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) - A terminal multiplexer.

All the time.

### [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) - A command-line interface to GitHub.

Productivity up to 11.

### [gitk](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) - The Git repository browser.

No frills. Just an amazing tool.

### [Brave](https://brave.com/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) - The browser that puts you first.

Switched to Brave in early 2024. Love it. I now use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) + [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) only for development. I used to use Chromium for development too, but now I use Brave because it's essentially the same underlying engine.

### [Dotfiles](https://github.com/gerardroche/dotfiles?ref=blog.gerardroche.com)

My setup and configurations for Ubuntu 24.04, bash, vim, git, and much more.

### [Liferea](https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea?ref=blog.gerardroche.com) - A feed reader/news aggregator.

Yes, I still use a feed reader. I'm just an old chunk of coal.
