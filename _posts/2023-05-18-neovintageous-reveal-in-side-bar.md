![The Prestige (2006)](/assets/2023-05-18-the-prestige.webp)

You can reveal a file in the side bar by right mouse click and selecting Reveal in Side Bar but why work so hard. [Create a mapping](/2022/11/21/vimrc-and-neovintageousrc/) and reload your rc file:

```
nnoremap <leader><leader> :RevealInSideBar<CR>
```

Pair it with a [Side Bar Toggle](/2023/05/15/neovintageous-toggle-sidebar/) mapping to up your power user game.
