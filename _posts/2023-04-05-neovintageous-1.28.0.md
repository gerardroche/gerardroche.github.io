NeoVintageous 1.28.0 has been released.  The highlights are persisted macros and registers, go to recent file command, and session performance improvements.

## Persisted macros and registers

Recorded macros and registers are now persisted on restarts. Macros are also now recorded and stored globally instead of at a window level.

## Go to most recent used file

The `<C-^>` command is a quick way to toggle between two files.

Mostly the `^` character is positioned on the 6 key, pressing CTRL and 6 then gets you what we call `CTRL-^`.

## Performance enhancements

In builds `>=` 4081 sessions are saved on exit instead of at runtime.
